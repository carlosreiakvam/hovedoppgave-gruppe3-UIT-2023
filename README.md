# Journey of the Heroes

Welcome to Journey of the Heroes! This is a multiplayer online game where the objective is to find the ring and deliver it to the village gate. 
## Game Objective

The goal of Journey of the Heroes is to find the ring and deliver it to the village gate. You will be competing against other players who are also searching for the ring, so you need to be quick and strategic.

## Gameplay

Players will spawn in a village and will need to explore the surrounding area to find clues that will lead them to the location of the ring. Once the ring is found, the player must bring it to the village gate while avoiding the enemy with a sword. The player who delivers the ring to the village gate first wins the game.

## Controls
